            finished as follows unless otherwise noted: all regions were
            either double-stranded or sequenced with an alternate chemistry or
            covered by high quality data (i.e., phred quality >= 30); an
            attempt was made to resolve all sequencing problems, such as
            compressions and repeats; all regions were covered by at least one
            subclone; and the assembly was confirmed by restriction digest,
            except on the rare occasion of the clone being a YAC. The
            following abbreviations are used to associate primary accession
            numbers given in the feature table with their source databases:
            Em:, EMBL; Sw:, SWISSPROT; Tr:, TREMBL; Wp:, WORMPEP; Information
            on the WORMPEP database can be found at
            http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/C_elegans/wormpep Sequence from
            the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium whole genome shotgun may
            have been used to confirm this sequence. Sequence data from the
            whole genome shotgun alone has only been used where it has a phred
            quality of at least 30. IMPORTANT: This sequence is not the entire
            insert of clone RP23-279F23. It may be shorter because we sequence
            overlapping sections only once, except for a short overlap. During
            sequence assembly data is compared from overlapping clones. Where
            differences are found these are annotated as variations together
            with a note of the overlapping clone name. Note that the variation
            annotation may not be found in the sequence submission
            corresponding to the overlapping clone, as we submit sequences
            with only a small overlap. The true left end of clone RP23-279F23
            is at 1 in this sequence. The true left end of clone RP23-149P17
            is at 55896 in this sequence. The true right end of clone
            RP23-100B18 is at 5088 in this sequence. RP23-279F23 is from the
            RPCI-23 Mouse BAC Library constructed by the group of Pieter de
            Jong. For further details see http://bacpac.chori.org/ VECTOR:
